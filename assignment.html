    <h2>Subjects of study </h2>
    <P>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded researchfacility - as long as the subject for somewher in the realm of science and technology. you seem like an intelligent, dedecated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:  </P>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of resevertrol(C14H12O3.)</li>
        <li>measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30oC(86oF), when the audence size exponentailly increases (effect of 3*10^3 increasing to 3*10^4.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, inducle the how long you'd expect the the research to take, required staff and other resource, and anything else you we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves </h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! as part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitons: </p>
    <dt>polynesian chicken dance </dt>
    <p>A little known but very influental dance dating back as far as 300BC, whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitfull".</p>
    <dt>Icelandic brownnian shuffle </dt>
    <p>Before the icelander developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to ton practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling thier bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, every rapid movements. One of my fellow students use to say that he though this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <p>An interesting exampple historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style charaterised by "robotic", stilted movement, being practiced by inhabatants of Northern Alaska Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
    <p>Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
